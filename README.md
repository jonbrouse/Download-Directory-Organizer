# Download-Directory-Organizer
Organizes files in downloads directory by classifying them into different folders according to their file types.  This project is inspired by http://dropit.sourceforge.net/.  Written in Python 3  My Download folder was cluttered and it need to be organized instead of doing it manually I wrote a basic python script to do it for me.
